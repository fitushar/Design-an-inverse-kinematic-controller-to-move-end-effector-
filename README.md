The task was to design an Inverse Kinematic controller to move the end-effector from the position
pA to the position pB The movement should be repeated 3 times
by control:
* the position-only without exploiting the redundancy
* the position and the orientation without exploiting the redundancy (desired orientation equal to the initial one)
* the position and the orientation avoiding an obstacle put in p0 (desired orientation equal to
the initial one)
